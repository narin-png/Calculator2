# Calculator
This project implements a simple calculator in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo) on two numbers. Uniquely, the program does not use conditional statements like if-else, but instead relies entirely on the ternary operator (? :) to determine and execute the chosen operation.
